My name is Victor Moreno, 

I'm a 30yo Mainframe developer with 3 years of experience on a healthcare company but looking to change technologies and start a new career as a full stack software developer in current technologies like: Linux, Python, PostgreSQL, Git, Java, Jenkins, Javascript, Maven, Selenium, Spring, Terraform, Kubernetes and Docker.

Currently learning about Linux, Python and starting with Git.
